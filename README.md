Flixel Hackathon Game
===========

The game I made at my first hackathon (freshman year).
I can't remember why I called it RPG, maybe "Really Poor Game"?
The music and sound effects are not mine, but I threw together the gorgeous art.
Made with Flixel.

It requires FlashDevelop to actually recompile. Oh the joys of AS3.
